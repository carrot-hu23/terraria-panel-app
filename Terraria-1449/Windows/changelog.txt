Version 1.4.4.9 Changes -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Changes:
- Updated localization of non-English languages to include all of the post-1.4.4 hotfix content and text adjustments & changes
- Recorded Music Boxes thrown into Shimmer will now be transmuted back into blank Music Boxes
- Updated over one hundred sprites to modernize some older and dated assets. 
- In tandem with the above, reset the scale stat on about 90 swords and tools back to 1. Over time and various updates, many of these weapons had their "scale" multiplier increased, a balancing stat that increases their size to give them a bigger hitbox. Unfortunately, this results in increasingly distorted and inconsistent pixel size across our weapons. All of the affected weapons/tools have had their sprite increased in size to reflect their actual in-game size, and then the scaling factor reduced back down to 1. This will result in both modernized versions of some old sprites, but less stretched, size appropriate weapon sprites to match their intended size. In practice, this will result in minimal actual impact on their in-game hitbox size, but when there is a change, it is almost always a difference of a pixel or two, and usually in favor of making the weapon slightly bigger.
- An important note for Resource Pack makers: any sprite replacements in resource packs for any of these updated Swords/Tools will no longer function, because the old sprites are not the same size as they are now. To update resource packs which change the appearance of these weapons, the replacement sprites will need to be resized to match the new expected sprite size.

I. Changes:
- Made some optimizations to Mac performance. We are interested in feedback on how successful this is, and if possible, will try to follow up on other areas that also need improvement.

Please let us know if there are any improvements or issues as a result of the optimizations!

- Fixed Steam deck users being unable to use smart cursor when using precise aim methods (trackpad, attached mouse)

III. Balance:

Swords with Range Boosting Auras (Excalibur, Horseman's Blade, etc)

- Spawned bees can now crit based on Melee critical chance

Night's Edge
- Damage reduced from 42 to 40
- Usetime increased from 21 to 25

- Pierce count on projectile increased from 3 to 4

Death Sickle:

Terra Blade

North Pole
- Flakes that are very close to each other will now slightly push away from each other, resulting in flake spread when falling

Undertaker
- Damage reduced from 22 to 19 (partially undoing the 1.4.4 buff)

Phoenix Blaster

- UseTime reduced from 17 to 14

Aqua Scepter

Houndious Shootius
- Increased hitbox size of the projectile

Optic Staff
- Base damage increased from 21 to 24 (Spazmamini's damage is 100% of base damage)
- Retinamini's damage scaling reduced from 1.25x to 1.15x of base damage (still a slight increase due to the increased base)

Frost Hydra
- Projectiles set changed to use static immune frames instead of global

Sleeping/Sitting in Chairs

- Fixed a worldgen issue where Dead Man's Chest minibiome traps could generate over other containers and break them

- Fixed Slimers having an inadvertent double chance to drop Monster Meat
- Reverting a change in 1.4.4.6 relating to ipv6 IPs to resolve a bug; will be re-evaluated in a future hotfix

Version 1.4.4.6 Changes -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Content Changes and Balance Changes
- The Angler's Accessory Drop Duplicate Protection has been adjusted to make it more flexible and player friendly. Instead of only selectively applying duplicate protection to the 2 triple sets of accessories independently, he now applies the duplicate protection to all 7 accessories, including the Fishing Bobber. If the player has any of the 7 accessories (either in their individual form or their tinkered forms, such as Shellphone) in their inventory, the Angler will always give a non-duplicate accessory whenever he rolls to drop an accessory at all. He will only begin dropping duplicates again once the player has all 7 in their inventory. This will also result in a general increase in the number of accessories he drops.
- As a follow-up change to the above, the Mermaid and Fish Costume have been moved to be before Accessories in priority order since Accessories will be more common.
- Pulling items out of stacks now speeds up faster after a few seconds to account for the larger stack size
- Adjusted some unintuitive spawning conditions with unsafe Dungeon and Underground Desert Backwalls, where they required a wall to be placed behind the block where the enemies would be spawning instead of just above it. This is no longer the case.
- It has come to our attention that the Goblin Summoner does not, in fact, drop any Summoner items. This is an unacceptable discrepancy, so the Goblin Summoner has been demoted to Goblin Warlock.

- Added recipes to craft Sandstone and Hardened Sand Blocks at a Solidifier

- Lava Charm can now be transmuted into Magma Stone
- Increased the visibility of the Oiled debuff to make it more clear when it is active
- Silver and Tungsten Bullets will now give 1 ore when decrafted in Shimmer, instead of 1 bar
- Copper Shortsword, Copper Axe, and Copper Pickaxe will now give 1 Copper Ore and 1 Wood when decrafted in Shimmer (instead of not being decraftable at all)
- Reduced the sell value of the Glass Kiln
- Crispy Honey Blocks are now highlighted by Dangersense Potions on FTW Seeds
- Cacti are now highlighted by Dangersense Potions on Constant Seeds
- FTW Random Angel Statue replacement should no longer impact Dungeon Chests, including the HM Biome Chests

II. Bug Fixes:
- Fixed an issue where Ice Golems, Angry Nimbi, and Rainbow Slimes wouldn't spawn reliably on Remix seed. They should now properly spawn during rain/blizzards.
- Fixed Molecart being able to dig through Demon Altars pre-Hardmode, and also being able to dig through chests with items in them
- Fixed an issue where Pumpkin Moon enemies were scaling way too much in multiplayer, including an entirely unintended damage scaling
- Fixed an issue where Frost Moon enemies were NOT scaling in multiplayer as intended (they should behave the same as the now fixed Pumpkin Moon scaling)
- Fixing (again) Brain of Cthulhu telefragging players
- Fixed the Guide to Peaceful Coexistence being flagged as a material when it was not a material
- Fixed an issue where ipv6 addresses were not functioning correctly for multiplayer servers
- NPCs or Critters spawned via spammable sources (by placing them, by statues, etc) are now flagged as such, and will be automatically replaced by regular spawns if they reach the spawn limit. This also applies to Queen Bee's Bees.
- Related fix to the above, the game will now spawn more faelings at once from critters dropped into Shimmer, as they will no longer interfere with natural spawns
- Fixed Hand of Creation having a lower rarity than Architekt Gizmo Pack
- Fixed several world name generator words that used an inconsistent apostrophe
- Revised a number of tooltips relating to Ammo and Mana Consumption to be more consistent
- Revised Celestial Shell accessory line's tooltips to be on more lines so that the text didn't scroll off the screen on small resolutions.
- Revised tooltips for a few other armor pieces to have more consistent order/phrasing
- Fixed some minor grammatical issues in some bestiary entries
(Note: Localization/tooltip adjustments in 1.4.4.5 and 1.4.4.6 are only to English at this time, and will be added in other languages in a subsequent hotfix)
- Fixed an issue causing players in Everything seed to get boosted boss death timers when in single player

- Fixed an issue where the Environmental Preservation Guide effect would prevent traps from breaking tiles

- Fixed an inconsistency with the collision size of some dart trap darts

III. Labor of Love: Balance Changes:

A. Global Mechanics Changes
Static Immunity Frames Last Hit
- All piercing projectiles that use static immunity no longer apply immunity on their "final hit", if they are a projectile which expires after enough pierces. This has very little impact on 	previously existing static immunity projectiles, but is important for several projectiles which are being changed to use static instead of global. Global Immunity projectiles already do 		this, so this change was made to account for some projectiles which were being changed from global to static, so that they did not receive an accidental damage nerf.

Buff/Debuff Caps
- Player buff/debuff maximum increased from 22 to 44.
- Enemy debuff maximum increased from 5 to 20

Post-Death Invincibility

Wall of Flesh
- Hungries no longer gain a 3rd stat bonus after 25% Wall of Flesh health. They will continue to use the 2nd stat bonus from 50% WoF health for the remainder of the fight.
- Wall of Flesh's tongued debuff pull speed now scales with the boss's speed in Expert/Master, to prevent the Wall from moving faster than it pulls you in at the end of the fight

Queen Slime
- Maximum flight speed and acceleration in Phase 2 have been reduced by about 15%
- Queen Slime's minion projectile damage reduced from 30/80/150 to 30/68/120
- These same projectiles now generate some light to be more visible at night

- Final Health values have increased from 50k/60k/76.5k to 60k/78k/99k
- Now invincible immediately after being summoned, and during his phase transitions
- Fixed an issue where Duke Fishron's Cthulhunado would sometimes instantly spawn on the player and hurt them, unavoidably. It should now spawn a certain distance below the player if there is no floor or platforms directly below, allowing the player time to avoid it
- When Enraged, Duke Fishron is much faster, and fires more frequent and faster Cthulhunados

Empress of Light
- Fixed a issue where Empress of Light would sometimes teleport directly on top of the player after an attack
- Now takes up more MANY more enemy slots, reducing or outright eliminating enemy spawns during her fight. 

Daytime Empress of Light, Skeletron, Skeletron Prime, and Dungeon Guardian
- "Instant kill" attacks will no longer be avoided by Dodge procs such as Hallowed Armor or Master Ninja Gear

Lunatic Cultist
- Health scaling factor in Expert/Master increased from 1.25 to 1.5
- Final Health values have increased from 32k/40k/51k to 32k/48k/61k

C. Enemies, Threats and Invasions
Projectile Reflecting Enemies (Large Mimics, Selenians) (Nerf)
- Reflected Projectiles now only deal half-damage to the player
- Reflected Projectiles no longer scale and deal extra damage in Expert/Master mode.

Teleporting Enemies (Teleporting Casters, Chaos Elementals, and Nebula Floaters)
- The protection radius around the player preventing them from teleporting directly onto you has been increased substantially
- The game will now also take your speed and direction into account when you are moving, and will further attempt to prevent these enemies from spawning directly in your path without time to react. However, this system is not absolute and only gives some extra distance, so it is still possible to crash into a recently teleported enemy if you do not alter course or are moving very fast.
- The protection radius around the player is even higher for Chaos Elementals and Nebula Floaters due to their not being stationary

Lifeform Analyzer Rarities
- A number of enemies rare enough to show up on the Lifeform Analyzer have had their rarity levels changed to give proper priority based on enemies which they co-exist with. For example, Dye Beetles have been reduced to Rarity 1, so that any higher Rarity enemy will take priority on the display.
- Voodoo Demons are now also listed on the Lifeform Analyzer

Pumpkin Moon and Frost Moon
- Pumpkin Moon can now go up to Wave 20. Wave point requirements for Waves 15-20 match Frost Moon.

- Pumpkin Moon bosses are now capped in number, more closely resembling the behavior of Frost Moon bosses
- Increased the number of enemy slots taken up by Mourning Wood and Pumpking, to be more in line with Frost Moon bosses, dramatically reducing how many can spawn at a time
- All regular enemies in Pumpkin/Frost Moon now have low per-player Health scaling in Expert/Master multiplayer. The boss units already had scaling.
- Pumpkin Moon trophies now drop using Frost Moon drop rates, instead of dropping from 100% of Wave 15 kills.
- Pumpkin Moon boss drop-rate-by-wave multiplier has been reduced, though drops are still more common than Frost Moon levels. This is partly to account for having a higher wave cap, though drops are still slightly less common than before.
- Both Pumpkin Moon and Frost Moon's "expert drop bonus" modifier has been reduced slightly, with the base drop rates being increased by the same amount. The end result is that Classic mode drops are slightly more generous, while Expert drop rates stay the same. (This is after taking Pumpkin Moon's previous change into account)
- Both Pumpkin Moon and Frost Moon now receive a 2.5x point multiplier when playing in Master mode. Previously, they received a 2x multiplier in Expert, but no additional gain in Master.

- Health reduced from 2000 to 1250

- Due to increased number present in the event, increased the kill count needed for a banner
- Reduced base Spooky Wood drop count due to increased numbers of Splinterlings killed per Pumpkin Moon. However, due to the faster point gain in Expert/Master, they now have bonus drop quantities in Expert and Master.

Hellhound
- Health increased from 1200 to 1800
- Pumpkin Moon wave progression points increased from 4 to 5
- Due to increased number present in the event, increased the kill count needed for a banner

- Defense increased from 28 to 34
- Increased the number of enemy slots taken, to be more in line with Frost Moon bosses, dramatically reducing how many can spawn at a time

Pumpking
- Health increased from 22000 to 26000
- Defense increased from 36 to 40
- Increased the number of enemy slots taken, to be more in line with Frost Moon bosses, dramatically reducing how many can spawn at a time

After this change, Alien Larvae simply won't spawn on Queen death once this internal limit is reached.

- Projectile speed bonus now also increases speed gained from ammo. Previously, it only increased the bow's projectile speed value.

Philosopher's Stone and Charm of Myths
- Potion Sickness reduction is no longer "front-loaded" at the time of using the potion. Instead, the cooldown is dynamically updated whenever the accessory is equipped. Equipping it will reduce the remaining cooldown proportionally, and removing it will increase the remaining cooldown proportionally. As long as you are wearing it, your effective remaining cooldown is reduced. This means that it you wear it for half of a minute and then remove it, you will only reduce 7.5 seconds from the total cooldown instead of 15.

Version 1.4.3.3 Changes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Changes and Balance

- Summon Minions, Sentries, and their projectiles should no longer harm critters
- Updated Bundle of Balloons' sprite to reflect the items that went into it better
- When placing a Graveyard-crafted version of a natural backwall directly next to a natural version of that wall, they should now merge seamlessly rather than having a large border between them
- Skeletron now drops Healing Potions instead of Lesser Healing Potions. This same drop will also be applied to Deerclops, though Queen Bee will continue to drop her Bottled Honey instead.

Deerclops:
- The Guide now has a hint about how to find Deerclops if the player has not yet defeated it
- Deerclops' HP values now scale at a modified rate in Expert and Master, like other bosses. As a result, it will now have a lower maximum HP in both Expert and Master.
- The above fix also addresses an issue where Deerclops' HP did not scale UP with increased player count in Expert/Master multiplayer games
- Deerclops now only remains present in the Snow biome for 1 day when no players are present, instead of 3 days.
- Deerclops' boss bar will disappear from the screen when suitably far enough away from it that the boss fight is not active. It will re-appear again once the fight is resumed.
- Fixed an oversight where Deerclops had 0 defense
- After defeating Deerclops, it now only has a 25% chance to spawn again naturally under proper conditions. This was previously 100% chance.
- Deerclops now drops potions on death; in this case, regular Healing Potions like Skeletron.

NPC Happiness:
- Pylons now require a minimum of 2 NPCs under all conditions to be sold
- The minimum required happiness for NPCs to sell Pylons has been decreased from 0.85 to 0.9 (the lower the number, the happier). This means that it is now easier to make NPCs happy enough to sell a Pylon.
- If an NPC is present in a hybrid biome (for example, the Hallowed Desert), and they like at least one of those biomes, then they will gain positive happiness from the biome they like. This will only work for a liked biome vs a neutral/disliked biome; it will not allow a neutral biome to overcome a disliked biome. This also does not override major unhappiness/housing invalidation due to being near the Corruption, Crimson, or Dungeon.
- The number of NPCs you can have in a town before Crowded penalties begin to take effect has been increased by 1

- Flinx Fur now requires less to research in Journey mode
- All food (except Ale and Sake) now require less to research in Journey mode
- All Biome crates, as well as Dungeon and Obsidian Lockboxes, now require less to research in Journey mode
- Black and Pink Pearls are now more common when opening Oysters. Their sell value has been proportionally reduced.
- Obsidian can now be mined by Pickaxes of 55% mining power or higher
- When defeating the Wall of Flesh in normal mode, it will now always drop 1 weapon and 1 emblem, like Expert treasure bags do
- Heart and Star Statues are now twice as likely to be found in worldgen compared to other statues
- Increased Web Shooter's range by 25%
- Piranha Gun's Piranhas should now be much better able to keep up with rapidly moving enemies, assuming that enemy isn't teleporting or briefly becoming invulnerable
- Changed Fairy Wing's recipe to only take 99 Pixie Dust instead of 100 (as 99 is the max stack for Pixie Dust)
- Optimized worldgen during the Desert chest placement stage
- The Virtual Keyboard (in-game keyboard for Gamepad) is now used for IP/password entry and other Multiplayer text entry menus

- Fixed an issue where Lucy didn't speak if you cut down Palm Trees or Cacti
- Fixed some issues involving Jungle Shrines and Giant Mahogany Trees, where overlapping generation could cause broken chests

- Fixed an issue where Brain of Cthulhu would despawn if there wasn't enough room to teleport
- Fixed an issue where Paper Airplanes weren't correctly dropping in stacks

III. Balance Changes:

Melee
Brand of the Inferno
- Use time decreased from 25 to 20 in light of recent buffs to similar tier weapons

Chlorophyte Claymore
- Increased damage from 80 to 95 in light of recent buffs to similar tier weapons

Chlorophyte Saber
- Increased damage from 48 to 57 in light of recent buffs to similar tier weapons

Christmas Tree Sword
- Projectiles now deal 75% of the base damage instead of 50%

Ranged
Super Star Shooter
- Reduced use time from 12 to 18 (THIS IS NOT A NERF!)
- Reduced damage from 70 to 60 (BEAR WITH ME, ITS NOT A NERF)
- Note: Due to immune frame time, this will actually result in more consistent damage, and is actually a buff. The damage decrease was required to offset the significantly increased damage.

Magic
Betsy's Wrath
- Partially reverting damage buff from 1.4.1, reducing damage from 110 to 100

Summons
Hornet Staff
- Increased damage from 11 to 12 (building upon the initial increase in 1.4.1 from 9 to 11)

Vampire Frog Staff
- Reverting damage buff from 1.4.1, reducing damage from 13 to 11. The AI/functionality changes from 1.4.1 have been more than sufficient on their own, and the extra damage was unneeded.

Obsidian Armor
- Reduced the Minion damage bonus on the helmet and legs from 9% to 8% each
- Reduced the Minion damage increase on the set bonus from 25% to 15%
- Reduced the Whip speed increase on the set bonus from 50% to 35%

Spider Staff
- Summoning Spiders will now attempt to systematically summon the different types of spiders in order, rather than randomly. Due to immune frame schenanigans, this may result in more consistent damage, though it does not actually increase the maximum potential of the weapon.

Optic Staff
- Enemy immune frames caused by Spazmamini and Retinamini attacks have been reduced from 16 to 12
- Increased Spazmamini's movement speed while pursuing enemies

Deadly Sphere Staff
- Enemy immune frames caused by Deadly Sphere attacks have been reduced from 10 to 8

Firecracker
- Reduced explosion proc damage from 3x of minion base damage to 2.75x

Cool Whip
- Cool Whip now inflicts Frostburn a short duration on hit
- Increased the movement speed of the Snowflake minion by 50%

Desert Tiger
- Now "bounces on" its current target if that target is in the air, staying more firmly latched on and dealing damage
- Increased scaling damage per "minion slot" expended slightly (from 33% of base damage to 40% of base damage)

Rainbow Crystal Staff
- Partially reverting the damage reduction in 1.4, increasing its damage from 80 to 130

Mounts/Wings/Accessories
Celestial Starboard
- Made some adjustments to improve its handling, while still keeping the fix that made sure that Starboard got full dash distance

Star Cloaks
- Only creates stars now when taking damage from enemy sources

Black Spot
- Slightly increased acceleration, to slightly offset for the loss of overall speed in 1.4.1

Crafting Recipes
Chlorophyte Bars
- Reduced crafting recipe from 6 to 5 ore per bar

Chlorophyte Bullets
- Reduced crafting efficiency from 70 bullets per bar to 60 bullets per bar (to roughly maintain parity with the Bar crafting cost change)

Enemy Immunities:
Snow Flinx - Removed their Poison immunity
Wall of Flesh - Removed its Poison immunity
Queen Bee - Added Poison immunity
Morning Wood - Added Poison immunity
Twins - Added Poison immunity
Martian Probes - Added Poison immunity
Granite Golem/Elemental - Added On Fire/Hellfire immunity
Betsy - Added On Fire/Hellfire immunity
Frozen Zombies - Added Frostburn Immunity
Clingers - Added Cursed Inferno Immunity
Dark Mage Skeletons - Added Poison immunity

Version 1.4.1 Changes -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Terraria 1.4.1 New Content and Content Changes:

A. New Content and Changes
	Added the winners of the Terraria Vanity Contest:
		Plaguebringer
		Wandering Ronin
		The Timeless Traveler
		Floret Protector
		Capricorn
		Bonus winner: TV Head!
		All six of these are craftable with pre-Hardmode materials of various sorts, so that all players can experience these awesome vanity sets! Thanks to everyone who participated and voted in the Vanity contest, and especially to our winners!
	Added new Achievements
	Added a credit sequence and music track following Moon Lord's defeat for the first time. This can also be accessed from the main menu.
	Music Box (Journey's End) is now created by recording the Credits music sequence. Additionally, using it in a normal accessory slot will play the Credits in-game, while using it in a social slot will only play the music.
	Added a new Princess NPC, with a variety of related items (and a new hairstyle!)
	Added new early game Summon equipment: Flinx Fur Coat and the Flinx Staff!
	Added a new pre-Hardmode whip, craftable at Dungeon-tier
	Added a Lavaproof Fishing Hook + Angler Tackle Bag Tinker
	Bee Hives and Antlion Eggs can now be crafted and placed
	Added a "Rainbow Cursor" vanity accessory

B. Vanity Accessory Changes
	Ultrabright Helmet now supports visible hair when worn
	Armors and vanity items which draw on the back (backpacks, tails, wings, and capes) are now no longer mutually exclusive. This means that you can now have one of any of those four categories all displaying at the same time. Previously, only one of those could ever be visible at a time (for instance, if you had visible wings, you could not ever see a cape, backpack, or tail).
	Combat Wrench now displays on the player regardless of what other backpacks are currently shown (it is its own category of back-draw)
	Angel Halo now functions like Unicorn Horn, in that it will be visible regardless of any other head equipment or vanity that is equipped
	Accessories which draw on the head have also been split into several subgroups, which will allow several of them to be worn simultaneously. For example, Blindfold/Spectre Goggles in the eye slot, Nature's Gift/Obsidian Rose in the "flower" slot and Ginger Beard.
	Blindfold can now be visibly seen when wearing hats/helmets which show the face
	Wearing Diving Helmet-series accessories set to visible will override your helmet, allowing them to be seen instead of your helmet
	Obsidian Skull-series accessories that are set to visible are now compatible with hats/helmets that show the face, as it will replace your face with the skull. Due to the shape of the Skull not fitting standard "Terrarian face" shapes, on certain helmets, it will use a different sprite with a more standard layout. You can also wear virtually all physically compatible Head/Face accessories with the Obsidian Skull as well.
	Ginger Beard has been resprited, and if set to visible, is now compatible with hats/helmets that show the face. It is also now compatible with most other Head/Face accessories.
	Reworked Shield/Cape display so that Shields and Capes are now visually compatible with each other again. The Shield now draws "in front" of the Cape, instead of underneath of it, which led to many of the initial issues.
	Shields which are set to not be visible can still be dyed, and will show that dye when actively used (such as Shield of Cthulhu dash or Brand of the Inferno Block). Previously, if they were set to invisible, their active use version would never have dye.
	Long-player hair is now properly compatible with wings/backpacks, and will show the full length of the hair without being cut-off visually
	The special trails left by various types of running boots (Sailfish, Flurry, Flower, etc) are now also subject to vanity usage, and you can use the one you prefer either through re-ordering accessories or using the social slots
	Bone Glove now has visual vanity for the hand slot

C. Other Content/Design Changes
	The Journey Mode duplication menu has been overhauled, with the addition of several new filters to break up some of the larger categories
	Additionally, the Misc option in the duplication menu should more properly encompass items that do not fall under any other category
	Made minor updates to Boss Mask item sprites to match the mask sprites
	Sprite update for Orange/Amber Phasesaber
	Torch God now plays an Otherworldly track when that setting is toggled
	Bestiary now indicates if a drop is Wave-based/if it only drops after a certain wave in Frost Moon and Pumpkin Moon
	Loading Tips now appear when connecting to a server
	Thunder volume is now adjusted with the Ambient SFX settings rather than regular Sound settings (edited)
	Plantero's Sombrero has made its triumphant return
	Reorganized menu settings for resolution/fullscreen/windowed borderless to all use the same sub-menu, to reduce confusion
	Updated FNA (Mac/Linux related)
	Added RGB support for SteelSeries game peripherals
	Adding updated localization for all languages up to 1.4 (some 1.4.1 content may still be untranslated, and these translations will come in an upcoming hotfix)

	True Night's Edge
	Projectile damage now does 1.5x of the base damage
	Is now autoswing
	Is now crafted with the Night's Edge + some of all 3 boss souls. No longer requires a Broken Hero Sword.

	Projectile now pierces twice, hitting up to 3 enemies
	Applies a 15% damage penalty to the next hit for each enemy a projectile pierces

	However, that projectile now deals 50% more (increased from 60 to 90)

	Magical Harp
	Damage increased from 32 to 42
	Knockback increased from 0 to 0.25 (in other words, it now has knockback)

		Cool Whip's damage penalty is reduced from 33% to 30%
		Durendal's damage penalty is reduced from 30% to 20%
		Morning Star's damage penalty is reduced from 25% to 5% (due to its heavy hitting nature, it's almost absent)
		Dark Harvest's damage penalty is reduced from 30% to 10%
		Kaleidoscope's damage penalty is reduced from 15% to 10%

	Whip Range
	Every whip (except for Leather Whip) has had a range increase
	This increase is the smallest with earlier whips (Snapthorn only roughly 10% longer) and larger with later whips (several late game whips have a roughly 50% increase)

	Whips + Flasks
	Whips can now gain the benefits of Flask buffs

	Leather Whip
	Is now purchasable from the Zoologist at 10% completion instead of 15%, as 15% too often left it more efficient to just sequence break to the Jungle to obtain Snapthorn

	Finch Staff
	Finch should now be somewhat more reliable/accurate with hitting its targets. However, due to how early it is obtained, it is intentionally a little inaccurate, as this is part of its balancing.
	Enemies knocked back by Finches should almost always be knocked away from the player now, regardless of the angle of the Finch

	Optic Staff
	Technically a bug, but Retinamini's lasers were accidentally not set to use independent immunity timers, which meant that they were still conflicting with other piercing attacks, while the 1.4 changelog had indicated otherwise. This has been fixed, which should result in less immune-frame time for Retinamini lasers.

	Sanguine Staff
	The attack speed of Sanguine Bats has been increased from 60 to 66 (this is how long it takes to make their attack circuit)

	Xeno Staff
	Fire rate cooldown increased from 30 to 33 (roughly 10% slower attack speed)

	Tempest Staff
	Fire rate cooldown decreased from 60 to 50 (roughly 20% faster attack speed)
	Projectile Speed of the Sharkrons increased from 14 to 20
	Movement speed of the Tempests themselves increased by 50%, so they can chase after enemies more quickly

	Hornet Staff
	Damage increased from 9 to 11

	Vampire Frog Staff
	Damage increased from 11 to 13
	Enemies can now be damaged by their entire body, not just the tongue, when they are attacking
	Like with Optic Staff, this was technically a bug, but Vampire Frogs were not set to use independent immunity timers like most other minions. This has been remedied, so they should no longer interfere with other piercing projectiles.

	Pygmy Staff
	Projectile speed increased from 12 to 18 (with additional adjustments made to their fall rate to keep it consistent)
	Increased the range at which Pygmies will fire their spears by roughly 40%

	For more information about changes to the Oiled debuff, see the Buff/Debuff section

	Kaleidoscope
	Damage increased from 165 to 180

	Obsidian Greaves now give 9% Summon damage
	New Set bonus: Increase Whip Range and Speed by 50%. Additionally, gain another 25% Summon damage (43% total across the entire set)
	Note: This set will deal very high summon damage, but at the expense of a lower minion count. Instead, it focuses on dramatically improving the performance and damage of whips, and can still be obtained earlier, or as an alternative, to Bee Armor, but it may require a bit more legwork to obtain the set, given its new crafting station requirement.

	Molten Armor
	Molten Helmet now gives 7% Melee Critical Chance
	Molten Breastplate now gives 7% Melee Damage
	Molten Leggings now give 7% Melee Speed
	The 17% Melee Damage set bonus has been reduced to 10% (the 7% moved to the Breastplate)

	Spectre Armor (Hood)
	Note: Statistically speaking, this set has not changed! This is merely a re-organizing of stat changes and tooltip revision to be more clear to players
	The -40% damage penalty has been moved from the Spectre Hood itself (which now gives no bonuses at all, either positive or negative) and now comes from the Set Bonus
	The tooltip on the set bonus now attempts to be more clear about the fact that you are trading offensive power for healing benefits. Hopefully, this will lead to less confusion in the future about why this set works the way it does.

	Added 10% Mana Cost reduction to the Hood
	Added 10% Ammo Cost reduction to the Shirt
	Added 10% Melee Speed increase to the Pants

	Increased healing gain from 0.5 HP per second to 1 HP per second

	Band of Starpower/Panic Necklace
	(Cross-listing from Crafting Changes) Band of Starpower and Panic Necklace are now more easily available in all worlds. They can be crafted in a Graveyard at a Tinkerer's Workshop, by taking one of them and combining it with a Life or Mana Crystal. Band of Starpower + Life Crystal = Panic Necklace. Panic Necklace + Mana Crystal = Band of Starpower.

	Bone Glove
	This item has been completely overhauled and turned into an accessory
	When equipped, the player will shoot Crossbones towards their cursor whenever they are attacking, once per second. Consider it like a sword projectile, except it works for every weapon.
	The bones deal 25 class-neutral damage, but additionally ignore up to 25 enemy defense.
	Now also has vanity visibility in the Gloves spot
	Note: In practice, this should allow the Bone Gloves to be simultaneously viable for more classes than just Ranged, and also give it a bit more longevity

	Brain of Confusion
	Reduced the Critical chance bonus of the Mind Trick buff from 20% to 10%.
	Reduced the duration of Mind Trick by 1 second

	Celestial Cuffs
	Now has the +20 mana bonus that its component accessories granted

	Increased the breath capacity bonus by 50%

	Feral Claws and Titan Glove
	Moved the "gives autoswing for Melee weapons" perk to Feral Claws, making it available earlier for players. This perk still continues up the tinker chain, it is simply no longer present on Titan Glove specifically
	Titan Glove now has a new perk that increases the size of (eligible) melee weapons by 10%. This perk is also present on all of its tinkers; however, the effect does not stack.

	Fledgling Wings and Lucky Horseshoe
	The Lucky Horseshoe is no longer found in Sky Chests, and has been added to the underground Gold Chest loot pool
	In its place, Fledgling Wings have been added to Sky Chests and Sky Crates

	Flesh Knuckles/Berserker Gloves
	Defense increased from 7 to 8

	Fire Gauntlet
	Increased the 10% Damage and Melee Speed bonus to 12%

	Additionally, if hit while wearing any of these accessories, the player gains the Honey buff for 5 seconds

	Jellyfish Necklace and all of its tinkers
	Now lets off an extremely faint glow when out of water (less than the Shadow Orb light pet)
	Dramatically increased the brightness when in water

	Lava Charm
	Doubled its spawn rate, giving it a 1/20 chance to be found in Lava-layer chests or Lava fishing crates

	Magma Stone
	Now inflicts a special version of On Fire that deals 15 DPS instead of 4

	Molten Quiver
	Technically a bug fix, but Wooden Arrows converted to Flaming Arrows by using this accessory now properly gain the +2 damage that Flaming Arrows have. This bonus is only applied to Wooden Arrows, if using the Quiver with superior arrows it will not apply the bonus (as it would be using the superior damage bonus of those arrows instead)

	Obsidian Rose
	Increased the lava damage reduction from 30 to 45. This change applies to all of its tinkers, however, as a consequence, lava damage has been moved to its own immunity timer, as the change would allow lava to very easily be reduced to 1 damage with the proper loadout.
	Is now a component in the Lava Waders, extending its lava damage reduction to the Lava Waders, Hellfire Treads, and Terraspark Boots. This change is retroactive for people who have already crafted those items, of course!

	Panic Necklace/Sweetheart Necklace
	Increased duration of the Panic! buff from 5 to 8 seconds

	Pygmy Necklace
	Is now sold by the Witch Doctor in pre-Hardmode, giving summoning accessories some earlier-game accessibility (he still only sells it at night, however!)

	Star Cloak, Bee Cloak, Star Veil, and Mana Cloak
	The base damage of the Stars generated by these accessories has been increased from 30 to 75. In addition, these stars will ignore up to 25 enemy defense.
	This damage is multiplied by 2x in Expert mode, and 3x in Master mode (the defense penetration remains unchanged)
	Now uses local immune frames, will not interfere with other piercing projectiles

	Use time decreased from 18 to 13

	Bone Pickaxe

	The Living Mahogany Wand and Rich Mahogany Leaf Wand have a 1/200 chance of being dropped from TreeHit Jungle Trees

	Black Spot
	Top speed and acceleration decreased dramatically. Previously its top speed was higher than the UFO mount, but now it is less.
	Can no longer dash-into-mount to instantly reach top acceleration

	Scutlix Mount
	There was an unlisted change in 1.4 that dramatically reduced the range of the Scutlix mount's attack. This was a performance change, not a balance change, and cannot be fully reverted as a result.
	However, the reduced range (500) was able to be increased to 850 without reintroducing performance issues.
	Additionally, to compensate for the lost range, the damage of the Scutlix shots has been increased from 100 to 150

	Dark Mage's Tome
	This mount now steps up slopes and 1-block tiles like the Flying Carpet

	Witch's Broom 
	Slightly increased speed values so that it is a minor upgrade over the UFO Mount (since it is Expert exclusive)

	Flamingo Mount
	Top speed decreased from 7.5 to 6

	Pre-Hardmode Horse Mounts (Dusty Rawhide, Royal Gilded, and Black Studded Saddles)
	Top speed increased from 8 to 9

	Suspicious Looking Tentacle (Light Pet)
	Brightness increased by roughly 33%

H. Crafting Recipes and Drops

	Blood Rain Bow, Chum Caster, and Vampire Frog Staff
	Previously, killing a Wandering Eye Fish or a Zombie Merman had a flat 1/8 chance for the game to select ONE of the three items to drop, and it would only drop one. This has been changed so that each of the three items has their own independent 1/8 chance to drop. This means that you could potentially get more than one drop at once, and the three are no longer competing with each other, effectively increasing their drop rate by 3x.

	Bloody Tear
	Increased drop rate from 1/200 to 1/100 for standard Blood Moon enemies
	Increased drop rate from 1/200 to 1/25 for Blood Moon fishing enemies (Eyeball Fish, Zombie Merman, Blood Eel, Hemogoblin Shark)
	Increased drop rate from 1/9 to 1/5 for The Groom and The Bride
	Increased drop rate from 1/9 to 1/2 for Dreadnautilus. In Expert/Master, this drop rate is 100%.

	Sanguine Staff
	Increased drop rate from 1/5 to 1/2 for Dreadnautilus. In Expert/Master, this drop rate is 100%.

	Blade Staff
	Now drops from Queen Slime instead of Enchanted Swords

	Kites (From Balloon Slimes)
	Kites dropped from Balloon Slimes are roughly 3x more likely to drop. Paper airplanes are mostly the same, but now drop in small stacks

	Bone Serpent Kite
	Drop rate increased from 4% to 6%

	Sturdy Fossil
	Tomb Crawlers now have a chance to drop small amounts of Sturdy Fossil
	Oasis/Mirage Crates now have a chance to include Sturdy Fossil

	Valor/Muramasa and Golden Lock Boxes
	(Technically a bug) fixed an issue where Muramasa had twice the odds of dropping from a Golden Lock Box compared to other items
	Valor can now be found from Golden Lock Boxes

	Torches
	Jungle Torches now have a more efficient recipe, giving more torches per Jungle Spore
	If you have less than 20 torches at any point, you have an increased chance to get torches when breaking pots

	Mana Crystal
	In light of the increased spawn rate of Falling Stars in 1.4, the crafting recipe for Mana Crystals has been increased from 3 to 5 Fallen Stars

	Early Game Ore Tools, Weapons, and Armor
	The cost of making early game Ore equipment has been re-evaluated across the board with cost reductions to most items. This applies to Copper, Tin, Iron, Lead, Silver, Tungsten, Gold, and Platinum
	Pickaxes have had their crafting costs reduced from 12 to 10. Copper/Tin Pickaxes have been reduced to 8.
	Axes have had their crafting costs reduced from 9 to 8. Copper/Tin Axes have been reduced to 6.
	Broadsword crafting costs are generally unchanged, but Copper/Tin Broadswords have been reduced from 8 to 6
	Shortswords have had their crafting costs reduced from 7 to 6. Copper/Tin Shortswords have been reduced to 5.
	Hammers have had their crafting costs reduced from 10 to 8.
	Bows have NOT had their crafting costs changed.
	Copper and Tin Armor's costs (ordered from Helmet>Chest>Legs) have been reduced from 15/25/20 Bars to 12/20/16 Bars
	Iron and Lead Armor's costs have been reduced from 20/30/25 to 15/25/20
	Silver and Tungsten Armor's costs have been reduced from 20/30/25 to 15/25/20
	Gold and Platinum Armor's costs have been reduced from 25/35/30 to 20/30/25

	Hardmode Ore Swords
	The crafting cost for Cobalt and Mythril Swords has been reduced from 10 to 8 Bars
	The crafting cost of Palladium and Orichalcum Swords has been reduced from 12 to 10 Bars
	The required bars to craft Adamantite and Titanium Swords has not changed, but see the next section for more info

	Adamantite/Titanium Bars
	The crafting cost of Adamantite/Titanium Bars has been reduced from 5 to 4 Ore. Subsequently, this reduces the cost of all Adamantite/Titanium armor, weapons, and tools

	Jester Arrows
	The crafting efficiency per Fallen Star has been reduced by half. You now get 10 arrows per star rather than 20.

	Super Star Shooter
	Rather than being sold randomly from the Traveling Merchant, this weapon is now crafted with the Star Cannon and Hallowed Bars

I. Buffs/Debuffs

	Frostburn
	"Player" Frostburn now does 8 DPS like "Enemy" Frostburn

	Cursed Inferno
	Technically a bug fix: 1.4 purported to increase Cursed Inferno damage from 12 to 24, but this was in error due to misreading the code. In truth, this was an increase from 6 to 12. This has now been remedied, and Cursed Inferno now properly does 24 DPS. However, player-based Cursed Inferno has NOT been increased correspondingly, so they will still take 12 DPS.

	Venom
	Technically a bug fix: 1.4 purported to increase Venom damage from 12 to 30, but this was in error due to misreading the code. In truth, this was an increase from 6 to 15. This has now been remedied, and Venom now properly does 30 DPS. However, player-based Venom has NOT been increased correspondingly, so they will still take 15 DPS.
	Venom has been renamed to "Acid Venom". This is to reflect a dramatic overhaul to its enemy immunity. Enemies who are immune to Poison are no longer necessarily immune to Acid Venom, and Acid Venom will now usually impact undead, stone, metal, and poisonous enemies.

	Ichor
	Defense reduction has been reduced from 20 to 15

	Oiled
	Rather than individually boosting different OnFire-like debuffs with, admittedly arbitrary amounts, Oiled now adds an additional flat 25 DPS if the target is suffering from any of these debuffs. For example, if the target is On Fire (4 DPS), it will take 29 total if Oiled.

	Thorns Potion
	The Thorns effect from this potion has been increased from 1/3rd of the damage taken to 100% of the damage taken

	Dryad's Blessing
	The Thorns effect from this buff has been increased from 20% of the damage taken to 50% of the damage taken

	Debuff Immunity Overhaul
	Though far too extensive to fully document, hundreds of changes have been made to enemy debuff immunities across the game. Generally speaking, the majority of these changes were making enemies susceptible to debuffs which they were previously immune to.
	The Venom change previously mentioned is the most prominent example, with the vast majority of Venom immune enemies no longer being immune.
	A large number of enemies which were previously immune to Cursed Inferno no longer are, particularly many stone/metal enemies
	Previously, enemies which were immune to Cursed Inferno were also always immune to Shadowflame. This is no longer the case, and there are now enemies immune to one or the other, though on the whole, a lot less enemies are immune to Shadowflame than before
	Ghost-like enemies (Wraiths, Poltergeists, etc) are now almost always immune to all major debuffs, including Ichor. This does not extend to Whip-debuffs.
	A large number of enemies which were "immune to everything" no longer are. This includes several Pumpkin Moon enemies and Celestial Invasion enemies that were immune to everything for no apparent reason. They are now immune, or not immune, to various debuffs depending on their nature.
	Several enemies which are "immune to everything" intentionally (such as the Destroyer) are no longer immune to Whip-debuffs, as those are meant to be universal.
	Though there are a few exceptions, the vast majority of Confusion-immune enemies still are. Unfortunately, this is because Confusion requires specialized code for every type of enemy, and so the cost investment to make more enemies susceptible to Confusion is dramatically higher than simply "setting them to not immune" like the other debuffs.

J. Threats and Enemies

	Vicious Goldfish
	Now spawns naturally in Crimson water. Never actually spawned naturally before, with regular goldfish spawning instead.

	Antlion Larvae
	Life decreased from 45 to 35
	Damage reduced from 12 to 10

	Antlion Eggs
	Antlion Eggs are now less common in initial worldgen, so there should be less of them overall, making the Underground Desert slightly less dangerous
	Antlion Eggs will now slowly regrow over time, like Bee Hives in the Jungle, but like Bee Hives, only until there are a certain number in an area, to prevent over-saturation

	Rolling Cactus
	Reduced the base boulder damage by about a third, making them slightly less lethal (though still considerably dangerous) threats
	Increased the Cactus Thorn projectile damage from 20 to 30

	Angry Dandelion
	Technically a bug fix: fixed an issue where Angry Dandelion's projectile damage scaled twice, resulting in it doing far more than it should have, especially in Expert/Master

	Rock Golem
	Technically a bug fix: fixed an issue where Rock Golem's projectile damage scaled twice, resulting in it doing far more than it should have, especially in Expert/Master

	Wall of Flesh

	The size of the town detection has been doubled

	The Jungle and Corrupt/Crimson Worldgen
	Worldgen will attempt to avoid overlapping Corruption and Crimson biomes with the Jungle during initial worldgen. While it is possible to still have overlap, the worldgen system will strongly discourage it in general, so expect to see far less worlds with Corrupt/Crimson Jungles. This does not apply to the Hardmode infection strips.

	Armed Zombie/Throwing Skeleton Statues
	These can now be found in worldgen in any world difficulty, and will function normally in those worlds

	Shadow Chests in Worldgen
	Shadow Chests are now more numerous in worldgen, with the limit increasing from 7-10 to 10-15

	Pyramid Rarity
	Worldgen's chance to place Pyramids has been increased by 50%.

	The Bone Welder is sold when in a Graveyard, as the Dungeon is no proper home
	Living Looms will be sold if the player is carrying a Living Wood Wand (please see the Tools section about Living Wood Wand renewability)
	The Flesh Cloning Vat and Decay Chamber, while still sold by the Steampunker only in one type of evil world, can be crafted into each other in a Graveyard, with some Souls of Night

	Adjusted Mirage Fish and Pixiefish to be "uncommon" instead of "rare", to match other Quest fish

	These are still craftable, but are also sold by the Mechanic

	Mushrooms
	Regular orange mushrooms now have a potion sickness time of 30 seconds, instead of the full 60.

	Added some optimization to mannequins and hat racks to decrease their performance toll
	Added some protection against crashing while taking very large Camera mode snapshots
	Reduced liquid movement restrictions in multiplayer, which should translate to more liquid being allowed to move in servers at once

	Gold Shortsword damage increased from 11 to 12

	Flails
	Flails now have entirely new behavior, and a few different functionality modes.
	If you click and hold the mouse button, they will swing around rapidly, doing low knock back and hitting rapidly in a small circle around you.
	If you click and use them normally, you will shoot them forward similar to how they use to be used, but they will move much faster than they did before. The damage dealt is double in this mode.
	Finally, if you click while it is in midair after having shot it forward, it will drop suddenly and lay on the ground. This can be used as a stationary damaging obstacle like a Spiky Ball on enemies walking towards you.
	Some flails have had some stat tweaks to fit with this new setup, such as having slightly longer or shorter range, but generally speaking, all of them should perform better than before.

	Poison Staff
	Note: Previously, due to piercing immunity frames, only one projectile from each shot would hit each target, resulting in a lot of lost damage. We've implemented a system that allows ALL of the projectiles to hit a target, dramatically improving its shotgun-like functionality. However, to offset this gain, it has had to have some of its stats reduced. On the whole, this should now be a stronger weapon, however.

	When enemies are in range, it will constantly attack any nearby enemies, consuming mana for each attack.
	Can hit up to 3 targets with each attack (does not consume extra mana)
	Damage is now set to 40
	Mana cost has been decreased from 18 to 15, however, it can now fire up to 4 times per second, increasing the speed at which it consumes mana

	Reduced number of enemies that each projectile can hit from 7 to 5
	Applies a 25% damage penalty to the next hit for each enemy a projectile pierces
	Now has a range before projectiles die, 50% longer than Poison Staff's

	Wasp Gun
	Note: This may sound like a nerf on paper, but it trades "hit count" for total damage, and will actually result in dramatically more DPS for the Wasp Gun. Less Wasps, more damage.
	Damage increased from 21 to 31
	Use Time increased from 11 to 18
	Wasps can now bounce/pierce only 3 times instead of 4
	Wasps per Cast: Reduced to an average of 3

	Can no longer pierce and hit multiple enemies

	For the next two seconds, you will fire 3 total piercing blasts, each dealing a base damage of 250 (up from 100)
	After this, it will shoot the laser beam, which is unchanged from the original implementation
	You can also quick-fire pellets without charging. The fire rate of these pellets is much higher than the previous implementation.
	The mana cost of charging is unchanged, however, quick firing will naturally consume more mana as the fire rate has increased significantly.

	Nebula Blaze
	Use Time decreased from 15 to 12
	Mana cost decreased from 18 to 12

G. Summons:
	Summoned minions now adjust their damage dynamically based on your current equipment and damage buffs

	"Some (though not all) Summons now use their own damage immunity timer system. In practice, what this means is that they will no longer interfere with the use of other weapons by maxing out the enemy's immunity frames. All affected minions are set on their own damage timer to most correctly match their pre-change DPS, but some changes are to be expected comparing 1.3.5 DPS to 1.4 DPS. In general, even if there is some minor loss or gain of DPS compared to pre-change performance, it should be worth the improvement to overall performance. Examples of minions impacted by this change:
	- Slime Staff
	- Spider Staff
	- Pirate Staff
	- Optic Staff
	- Raven Staff
	- Deadly Sphere Staff
	- Stardust Dragon Staff
	- Some of the new summons also utilize this system"

	Titan Glove and its tinkers now give autoswing to all Melee Weapons (and Whips!)

	Wing Balance has been heavily balanced across the entirety of the game.
	With only a few exceptions, wings found at the same tier should be roughly equivalent in power. Exceptions are usually particularly hard or particularly easy to get.
	Unfortunately, its difficult to share exact stats for wings, partially because there are dozens of them that have been changed, and their stats don't easily translate to easily readable stats.
	The best short summary is that over a dozen sets of wings were buffed, and that Leaf and Frozen Wings have been reduced in power, as they were too strong for their tier.
	Other major notes:
	- Butterfly and Bee Wings can now only drop after the Mech Bosses, but their power has been increased proportionally.
	- Previously, most wings from Wall of Flesh until Golem were very similar in power, and didn't offer a lot of reason to upgrade. These have now been spread out, creating a more gradual, consistent increase in wing power across the course of the game.


	Shrimpy Truffle now gives its increased speed and damage bonus when in the rain.
	Basilisk Mount now has a double jump

	Bat Hook
	Pull In Speed decreased from 16 to 13  (This is the speed at which it pulls the player to the hook)

	Shoot speed increased from 15 to 16

J. Tools and Mining:
	All axes, hamaxes, chainsaws and other tools with axe-functionality have their wood cutting speed increased by 20%
	All drills and chainsaws now dig faster than their non-mechanical counterparts, but have shorter range. Additionally, optimized digging loadouts still perform better on pickaxes/axes, but drills and chainsaws will be faster on non-optimized loadouts
	Desert Fossil can now be mined at any pickaxe power or with bombs. However, it is fragile and adjacent fossil blocks may break when you mine it, costing you some of the ore.
	Desert Fossil based gear is now weaker because it is available sooner.
	Hellforges now require Demonite Pickaxe or higher to break. They also now protect the tiles below them from being broken while in the Underworld. This does not apply outside of the Underworld.

	Cactus Pickaxe
	Use Time decreased from 16 to 15
	Damage decreased from 5 to 4

	Bone Pickaxe

	The Well Fed buff has been divided into three tiers, with the lowest tier being equal to the original, and the strongest being 2x as strong as the original
	All of the Food in the game, including the 50+ new Food items, have had their durations and tiers adjusted to have a more consistent reward for the difficulty of obtaining them. Short duration foods might have a higher tier, while long duration foods might have a lower tier. Find what is most efficient for you!
	Well Fed Buff now gives a mining speed bonus
	Invisibility Potion now has an added benefit of reducing enemy spawn rates by 20%

	Cursed Inferno Debuff
	Damage per second increased from 12 to 24 on both player and enemy versions of the debuff

	Pygmy and Queen Spider Staff Venom duration decreased to mitigate the increased potency

IV. Journey's End: Bug Fixes:

A. Gameplay and Combat Bugs:
	Fixed an issue where Copper and Tin Bows were considered Melee weapons for the purposes of prefixes

	Fixed an issue where using Tome of Infinite Wisdoms right click functionality while on a Drill Mount would drain all of your mana almost instantly
	Fixed an exploit where dying to Chaos State while holding a Rod of Discord in the cursor on a Hardcore character would cause the next character used to inherit said Rod of Discord
	Fixed an issue where the last segment of Solar Eruptions blade didnt actually do damage
	Added protections to prevent a very rare bug where the Solar Eruption debuff would kill its own user

		Enjoy rewards in the form of armor, weapons, pets and more, all straight from the Dungeon Defenders 2 universe!

	Summoners can now direct their minions to attack a specific target of their choosing. To do this, the summoner must Right Click over an enemy while holding a summoning staff. Minions with line of sight on that enemy will target it immediately. However, if the minions do not have line of sight, they will continue to attack targets at random.
	The way Sentry Summons function has been changed somewhat.
		Outside of the DD2 Invasion event, you now have a limit of one sentry summon at a time
		Some of the 1.3.4 content can increase this limit
		Unlike before, when the sentry limit is above 1, you can summon multiple versions of the same sentry. For instance, with a sentry limit of 3, you could summon 3 Frost Hydras at the same time.
	Weve added an experimental new seed feature to World generation. All worlds generated in 1.3.4 and beyond will have a seed attached to them. You will also be able to set the seed for a world on world generation. PLEASE NOTE that this feature is not active by default. To activate it, please follow these steps:
		Find Terrarias config.json file. On Windows, this should be found in Documents>My Games>Terraria.
		Open the config file with a basic text editing program, such as Notepad.
		The 12th line in the config file is labeled EUseExperimentalFeatures" and will be set to falseE
		Simply change this to trueEand save the config.json file. The next time you launch Terraria, the option to view and set world seeds will appear.
	Please be aware that this is NOT a retroactive feature, and cannot display the seeds for worlds created before 1.3.4, as the data is simply not stored there.
